 ![AI-artificial-intelligence-brain-deep-learning](https://github.com/CBURKHARDT47/deep-learning-challenge/assets/128064003/7b908228-7830-42ca-a7ce-d4af0deff47c)



## 1. Overview of the Analysis
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you’ll use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## 2. Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing
*What variable(s) are the features for your model?
The first step in the data processing was to drop the EIN and NAME columns. Any remaining columns were considered as features for our model. 

*What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? 
The "IS_SUCCESSFUL" variable was the target for my model. A value of '1' meant the funding loan was utilized successfully/effectively, and a value of '0' meant the funding was unsuccessful/ineffective. 

*What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

## 3. Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
